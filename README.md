Project purpose:
	We made a game called The Giraffe game, the main idea is to eat only the good apples (green) and if you eat a poisonous apple (red) you die!
	There are interactive menus, where you can choose the difficulty of the game, to view the leaderboard (top 10 players), and customize the color of your giraffe.
	When you eat good apples your speed increases and the faster you move the more points you get from eating good apples.
	The highscore table is saved in a text file. 

	There is also an option for background music.
